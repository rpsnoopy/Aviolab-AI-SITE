case_study_heading: Case Study: Transforming IP Document Management for a Major Industrial Group
case_study_intro: How Aviolab AI revolutionized the Intellectual Property department of a Fortune 500 manufacturing company:

case_study_point2: Enhanced reliability of multi-document agreement processing
case_study_point3: Generated precise legal commentary in multiple languages
case_study_point4: Facilitated clear communication across international legal teams
case_study_point5: Specific risk level assessment for each identified critical issue
case_study_point6: Strengthened control over IP assets and contractual negotiation security
founder_testimonial_title: From the Founder
founder_para_1: When I founded Aviolab AI, I was fully aware of how complex and risky it is to analyze intellectual property contracts — too many variables, too many details to check manually.
founder_para_2: Today, with the TTR Suite, IP professionals can simply upload their documents and receive a complete analysis within minutes, with the confidence that every connection has been thoroughly assessed. One major industrial group shared how they used to spend days reviewing complex agreements; now, the same work is completed in just a few hours — or even minutes, in the case of NDAs and simpler contracts.
founder_para_3: We've also enhanced communication among international legal teams: the TTR Suite generates precise legal commentary and revision proposals in flawless legal language, in any language, ensuring both consistency and accuracy.
founder_para_4: We've turned a critical bottleneck into a strategic asset. With the TTR Suite, safeguarding IP assets is now easier, faster, and more reliable.
