case_study_point6: Strengthened control over IP assets and contractual negotiation security
founder_testimonial_title: From the Founder
founder_para_1: When I created Aviolab AI, I knew how complex and risky it was to analyze intellectual property contracts. Too many variables, too many details to verify manually.
founder_para_2: Today, with the TTR Suite, IP managers can upload documents and get a complete analysis in minutes, with the certainty that every connection has been evaluated. A major industrial group told us how they used to spend days examining complex agreements, while now the work is completed in a few hours, and for NDAs or simpler contracts, even in minutes.
founder_para_3: We have also improved communication between international legal teams: the TTR Suite generates impeccable comments and revision proposals in perfect legal language in any language, ensuring consistency and precision.
founder_para_4: We have transformed a critical process into a strategic advantage. With the TTR Suite, protecting IP assets is simpler, faster, and more secure.
